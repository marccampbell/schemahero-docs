title: Connect A Database
description: Learn how to configure SchemaHero to manage a database
---

In this step, we will deploy a PostgreSQL instance and configure SchemaHero to manage this instance.

To start, we need a PostgreSQL server to use during this tutorial.
In order to make this part easy, we've exported the PostgreSQL 11.8.0 Helm chart to plain Kubernetes YAML, and added it to the SchemaHero repo.

## Deploy PostgreSQL

Deploy PostgreSQL into a new `schemahero-tutorial` namespace with the following command:

```shell
kubectl create ns schemahero-tutorial
kubectl apply -n schemahero-tutorial -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schemahero/schemahero/main/examples/tutorial/postgresql/postgresql-11.8.0.yaml
```

## Validate PostgreSQL is running

After deploying this and waiting for the containers to start, you can connect to your PostgreSQL instance from the CLI using:

```shell
kubectl exec -it -n schemahero-tutorial \
  postgresql-0 -- psql -U airlinedb-user -d airlinedb
```

If you get a message that says `error: unable to upgrade connection: container not found ("postgresql")` wait a moment and try again.
This simply means that PostgresQL is not yet started.

(When prompted, the password for "airlinedb-user" is "password").

## Connect to PostgresSQL

For this demo, we'll switch over to a GUI-based database management tool to show the state of the database.
We like [Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/), but any database management tool you are comfortable with will work here.

Before you can connect using Beekeeper or another management UI, you'll have to create a port-foward using `kubectl` because the PostgreSQL instance we just deployed is not accessible outside of the cluster.

The following command will create the port-forward into the cluster.
Note that this will have to stay running to use Beekeeper Studio, so we recommend opening this in a new terminal window.

```shell
kubectl port-forward -n schemahero-tutorial svc/postgresql 5432:5432
```

Now, point your app to `127.0.0.1:5432` with the user "airlinedb-user", database "airlinedb", and password "password".

Explore this database and notice that it's empty.

## Create SchemaHero Database object

Now that we have SchemaHero running in the cluster and a PostgreSQL instance available, the next step is to provide the database info to SchemaHero so the operator can manage the database.
We do this by deploying custom resource to the cluster with the connection information.

 A `database` definition will allow SchemaHero to manage the schema of the database. A `database` definition includes a name type and connection parameters.

Create a file named `airline-db.yaml` locally, copy the following YAML in it, and then run `kubectl apply -f ./airline-db.yaml` to deploy it.

```yaml
apiVersion: databases.schemahero.io/v1alpha4
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: airlinedb
  namespace: schemahero-tutorial
spec:
  connection:
    postgres:
      uri:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: postgresql
            key: uri
```

Let's review this database object:

**Lines 1-2**: This is the GVK (Group, Version, Kind) of the object.
This should always be set to these same values, however the `v1alpha4` may change with future releases of SchemaHero.

**Line 4**: This is a new name that will be used by other SchemaHero objects to refer to this database.
It's common to set it to the same name as your database, but it's not required.

**Line 5:** The namespace of the object. This is where SchemaHero will watch for schemas, but is not related to the namespace of the database.
For our tutorial, we've chosen to deploy Postgres to this namespace, but SchemaHero easily supports the database in another namespace, another cluster, or externally managed (RDS, etc).

**Line 7-13:** This is the database reference that contains the data SchemaHero will need to connect to and authenticate into this database.
In this example, we are using a previously deployed secret (it was part of the PostgreSQL deployment earlier).
SchemaHero supports reading credentials from inline, secrets, or HashiCorp Vault.

## Validate SchemaHero

Once the SchemaHero database object is deployed, you can review it with:

```shell
kubectl get databases -n schemahero-tutorial

NAME        AGE
airlinedb   47m

```

## Next

Now that we have PostgreSQL and SchemaHero running, we then [deploy a new table using SchemaHero](https://schemahero.io/learn/tutorial/create-table) to this instance.
